<h1>Introduction To Operating System</h1></center>
<p>An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware.The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently. An operating system is a software that manages computer hardware. The hardware must provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the computer system and to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system. </p>
<p>An operating system brings powerful benefits to computer software and software development. Without an operating system, every application would need to include its own UI, as well as the comprehensive code needed to handle all low-level functionality of the underlying computer, such as disk storage, network interfaces and so on. Considering the vast array of underlying hardware available, this would vastly bloat the size of every application and make software development impractical. Instead, many common tasks, such as sending a network packet or displaying text on a standard output device, such as a display, can be offloaded to system software that serves as an intermediary between the applications and the hardware. The system software provides a consistent and repeatable way for applications to interact with the hardware without the applications needing to know any details about the hardware. </p>

<p> <b> <u> <center>Operating System â€“ Definition: </center> </u> </b> </p>
<li>An operating system is a program that controls the execution of application programs and acts as an interface between the user of a computer and the computer hardware.</li>
<li>A more common definition is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being application programs.</li>
<li>An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as memory, processors, devices, and information. The operating system correspondingly includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler, a memory management module, I/O programs, and a file system.</li>
